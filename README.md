# StopStalk

Stop stalking and Start StopStalking :sunglasses:

## Module Requirements

Note: Apply sudo if required for your system.

1. First, make sure the development packages of libxml2 and libxslt are installed

Assuming you are running a Debian-based distribution, you can install them by using:

```
apt-get install python-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev zlib1g-dev
```

Install the required packages by running:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Also, pip doesn't respect proxy while installing packages from the requirements file. So if you are using a proxy in your terminal you MAY use:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt --proxy=<proxy address>
```

2. To deploy the code, uglify-js and uglifycss needs to be installed

To install uglifyjs:

```
npm install uglify-js -g
```

To install uglifycss:

```
npm install uglifycss -g
```

## Installation

1. Install web2py (We need 2.14.6 version only) in a directory. We have committed the web2py source so that you can directly unzip and start using it

   - Unzip the web2py_src.zip somewhere outside the stopstalk directory.
   - After unzipping the web2py, copy the source of stopstalk to its applications directory
   - Final directory structure should be something like -
     - web2py/
       - applications/
         - stopstalk/
           - models
           - views
           - controllers
           - ...

2. Navigate into the applications directory in web2py directory.

   ```
   $ cd web2py/applications/
   ```

3. Install StopStalk by cloning this repository

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/stopstalk/stopstalk-deployment.git
   mv stopstalk-deployment stopstalk
   ```

   Note: Web2Py does not allow appname to contain hyphens.

4. Install MySQL (v5.6) - [here](http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/)
   Make sure you remember the root password for mysql server.

5. Create a database in MySQL

   ```
   $ mysql -u root -p        # Enter your mysql root password after this.

   mysql> CREATE DATABASE stopstalkdb;
   mysql> CREATE DATABASE uvajudge;
   ```

6. Copy `0firstrun.py` to `models/`

   ```
   $ cd stopstalk/
   $ cp models/0firstrun.py.sample models/0firstrun.py
   ```

7. Open `0firstrun.py` and change the settings.

   ```python
   current.mysql_user = "root" # Change if you have given access to any other user in mysql
   current.mysql_password = "" # As per your mysql password
   current.mysql_server = "localhost"
   current.mysql_dbname = "migration" # Will remain same as long as you followed 5.
   current.mysql_uvadbname = "uvajudge" # Will remain same as long as you followed 5.

   # Configure mail options
   current.smtp_server = "logging" # Mails will not be sent. Will be logged where the web2py server is running
                                   # Else you can set it to your smtp server.
   current.sender_mail = ""        # Not required if logging
   current.sender_password = ""    # Not required if logging

   current.bulk_smtp_server = "logging"
   current.bulk_sender_mail = ""        # Not required if logging
   current.bulk_sender_password = ""    # Not required if logging

   current.analytics_id = "" # Leave it empty if you don't want Google Analytics on Localhost
   current.calendar_token = "" # Leave it empty if you don't have an access token ID for Google Calendar API

   # Leave the following empty for very basic email validation
   # https://app.neverbounce.com/settings/api
   current.neverbounce_user = ""
   current.neverbounce_password = ""
   ```

   In case if you want to send emails - Install `postfix` for your respective OS and configure the above smtp server accordingly.

8. Install and start Redis - [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-secure-redis-on-ubuntu-18-04)

9. Install InfluxDB (1.7) - [here](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.7/introduction/installation/)

10. Navigate back to the web2py folder and start the web2py server.

    ```
    $ cd web2py
    $ python3 web2py.py -a yourPassword // Choose any password
    ```

11. Open the browser and go to the URL -

    `http://localhost:8000/stopstalk/`

**Note:**

- The database will be completely empty after installation

12. Done. :smile:

13. To setup syntax check before all of your commits, just create a file in applications/stopstalk/.git/hooks/pre-commit with just `make syntaxx_check` as it's content.
