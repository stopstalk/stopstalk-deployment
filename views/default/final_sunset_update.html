  <h1>{{=T("Final update from StopStalk")}}</h1>

  <p>
    This is a slightly emotional one. Bear with me and would love to see you
    read the complete article to learn from my journey of building StopStalk.
  </p>

  <p>
    You would have realized from the title that we are sunsetting StopStalk. It
    will not be available for usage post <strong>1st August 2025</strong>.
  </p>
  <h2>Back story of "Why" I built it?</h2>
  <p>
    It feels surreal that it has already been 10 years since this. It was back
    in 2015 when I was in my 3rd year of college in IIIT Hyderabad. Students
    always used to prepare for internships in the summer of 3rd year. Some of
    the students also used to prepare for Google Summer of Code. It used to be a
    common divide that some students were "developers" while others were
    "coders". I was also one of them while I wasn't best at either in the
    beginning. I was contributing to an open-source project called Sahana in the
    hope of applying for a GSoC proposal that summer along with practicing some
    questions here and there on websites like CodeChef, Codeforces, etc.
    Leetcode hadn't gotten as popular back then for interview prep (thankfully).
    I remember it having only a total of 200-300 questions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sahana was built on top of a web framework called Web2py. Their developers
    also developed another framework on top of Web2py with some more
    abstractions and modularizations called S3. As a newbie, I was struggling to
    understand which of the features were part of that core Web2py and which of
    them were implemented in S3. I decided to create my own Web2py application
    from scratch so that I could contribute more effectively.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was around that time when I also was stalking my friends' coding profiles
    by remembering their handles/usernames across every platform. This used to
    be my motivation for practicing more in the vacations when you're at home
    and you're also looking forward to getting an internship, which almost
    always asked DSA questions in their coding tests. I thought about writing a
    Python script that just crawls the recent submissions of some of my friends
    and shows it in the terminal. Soon I realized that putting a UI on top of
    this would be phenomenal (I wish I had that ugly screenshot of this v0
    dashboard). I quickly started building a Web2py dashboard on top of this to
    also help me learn for my Sahana contributions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Very soon, I realized that I can do a lot more on this database of
    submissions - give analytics, generate streaks, give GitHub calendar kind of
    graphs, View submissions, and more. This just made it more interesting. I
    bought the domain
    <a
      href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://stopstalk.com&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1751997820137569&amp;usg=AOvVaw20O6U9sUiJXi9yAyeggKk0"
      >stopstalk.com</a
    >&nbsp;and started figuring out all the AWS stuff. When you're building
    something on your "own", you have a high motivation for figuring out
    everything. I started giving it to my friends, posting on these competitive
    programming websites, and more that you can send "Friend Requests" on the
    platform to follow their coding submissions. I just couldn't stop thinking
    what else I could build on top of this to make it sweeter by the day.
  </p>

  <p>
    My CGPA continuously started degrading as I got addicted to building this.
    Fast forward 10 years, here we are discussing my journey and how we scaled
    from a simple Python script to 130k+ users.

  <h2>How is the traction like today?</h2>
  <p>
    This is something that makes me immensely happy - to
    <strong>build something that people want</strong>. For almost the last 5
    years, I have done <strong>zero</strong> social media posts, haven't
    recommended StopStalk to anyone, haven't actively engaged in any marketing
    activity whatsoever (we never spent a penny in acquiring any user).
  </p>

  <p>Here is a brief snapshot -</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Total of 130k+ users across the globe</li>
    <li>8 Competitive programming websites integrated</li>
    <li>54M+ submissions across all these users</li>
    <li>
      Multiple colleges using StopStalk rating as their placement criteria
    </li>
    <li>90k+ problems fetched from these websites</li>
    <li>
      A lot of candidates still linking their StopStalk profile in their resumes
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>How did it help me, personally?</h2>
  <p>
    StopStalk has helped me grow personally and professionally as a developer
    (frontend, backend, devops) as well as an entrepreneur.
  </p>

  <p>
    Back in the days, I was a newbie developer who had done some self-projects
    here and there in PHP, MySQL, jQuery.
  </p>

  <p>
    As part of building StopStalk, I learnt Web2py framework on the fly while
    contributing to Sahana as well as StopStalk. Figured out how AWS EC2 works,
    figured out all the DNS stuff, bought a domain, stitched everything
    together, and haven't stopped learning ever since.
  </p>

  <p>
    Learnt extreme ownership. I was resolving "support tickets" (emails at that
    time) within a few hours while I was studying computer networks and
    humanities and science and what not.
  </p>

  <p>
    Learnt debugging! This is the hardest skill in tech. Requires patience and
    sense of urgency at the same time. I still think I am great at debugging
    because of some of the pressure situations at StopStalk.
  </p>

  <p>
    All of this experience was extremely overwhelming and fulfilling at the same
    time. I remember giving the final hiring manager round for an internship
    interview with BrowserStack - He asked me how did you deploy StopStalk?
    Explain how you connected your DNS provider? And more in-depth questions
    around StopStalk only. I guess he got impressed with these specifically
    since I wouldn't be able to answer these questions if I had just done course
    projects.
  </p>

  <h2>Why did we never monetize StopStalk?</h2>
  <p>
    The short answer is we did try. We tried reaching out to companies who could
    find vetted candidates from StopStalk. We tried reaching out to edtech
    companies. We tried talking to colleges for premium offerings of
    leaderboards/score/etc. We tried Ads. And, we also tried donations ðŸ™‚
  </p>

  <p>Some learnings around monetization (in no particular order) -</p>
  <ol>
    <li>We were too early for the market</li>
    <li>
      The contextual data that we used to provide to companies was pretty niche
    </li>
    <li>College Students did not have money to pay (at least in those days)</li>
    <li>
      Ads &amp; Donations was the last resort just to pay the StopStalk bills
      but we stopped them almost immediately once we saw the response.
    </li>
    <li>
      There was a skepticism back in the mind that the data that we were
      providing was primarily built on crawling (we did have official APIs as
      well in some cases). A platform can any day choose to block us and we will
      have to rely on skewed data for new users which would have been a mess. In
      hindsight, this was definitely a right decision.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    There could have been some angle for sure in today's market to make some
    money out of StopStalk but point number 5 was the biggest reason why we
    didn't aggressively pursue it.
  </p>

  <p>
    So for 10 years we have been live, with negligible money coming in from an
    experiment of donations/ads and AWS bills being completely paid from my own
    savings.
  </p>
  <h2>Why are we sunsetting down StopStalk?</h2>
  <p>
    As much as I would have personally loved to continue StopStalk, it really
    doesn't seem to be helping the users in the current state. Here are some of
    the concrete reasons why we are shutting it down (from highest to lowest
    priority) -
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      The "competitive programming" how it used to be back then has died down in
      favour of platforms like Leetcode. I personally feel it's unfortunate as
      now the candidates are just doing "interview prep" and at times just
      remembering solutions to clear interviews of the top tech companies. 10
      years ago, competitive programming was sort of a sport (at least in my
      college). Of course the end goal was still a job, but students used to
      really dive deeper and the contest ranks were seen as a thing to improve
      upon.
    </li>
    <li>
      The platforms that we support are also sort of in maintenance mode. This
      is loosely said but there is a very niche audience who is doing
      competitive programming for the ICPC sense of it.
    </li>
    <li>
      The APIs/crawling scripts of these websites are breaking more often than
      what I would expect. This has led to a lot of failure, incorrect data and
      skewed information.
    </li>
    <li>
      Because of point 3, my own trust of StopStalk rating has dropped as well.
      I would not want candidates to be judged for their campus placements on
      StopStalk rating, not because it is not a good number, but because the
      rating itself is skewed because the crawling might not have happened for
      some candidates and might give unfair ranking.
    </li>
    <li>
      Monetarily it is not feasible to maintain it anymore. Not just AWS bills,
      but also the dev effort to work on resolving this. Note that we have also
      not migrated to a newer framework so we are sort of stuck with a very old
      web framework called Web2Py (loved it back then though!).
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Final remarks</h2>
  <p>
    I genuinely love each and every single user who signed up on StopStalk and
    want to thank every one of you for helping us come this far. It was the fuel
    to my motivation of continuing to build more features to give a more
    detailed analysis of a candidate's competitive programming journey.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am sorry that we have to unfortunately shut it down, but trust me, I would
    have continued it if the platform was able to deliver the same value as it
    used to 5 years ago in a student's competitive programming journey.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also need to thank a lot of my friends and family members who supported me
    along the way and were also equally proud of me building StopStalk.
